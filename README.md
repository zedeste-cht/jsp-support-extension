# JSP Language Support

This extension provides complete support for JavaServer Pages (JSP) files in Visual Studio Code.

## Notes

This project is based on the original work: [jeromyu2023/vscode-jsp-support](https://github.com/jeromyu2023/vscode-jsp-support).

Because of a path issue, this repository was cloned and modified for further adjustments.

## Features

### Syntax Highlighting
- JSP Directives (`<%@ ... %>`)
- Scriptlets (`<% ... %>`)
- Expressions (`<%= ... %>`)
- Declarations (`<%! ... %>`)
- JSP Standard Actions (`<jsp:include>`, `<jsp:param>`, etc.)
- Embedded HTML and Java

### Go to Definition
- Navigate to Java class definitions from JSP files
- Supports both JSP and Java import styles:
  ```jsp
  <%@page import="com.example.MyClass"%>  // JSP import
  <%
    import com.example.OtherClass;        // Java import
    MyClass instance = new MyClass();     // Go to definition works here
  %>
  ```
- Works with:
  - Class references in code
  - Import statements
  - Fully qualified and simple class names
  - Classes in different package structures

### Autocompletion
- JSP Directives (page, include, taglib)
- Common Directive Attributes
- JSP Standard Actions
- Basic JSTL Tags
